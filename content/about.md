WIOS(Women in Open Source) chapter, focused on bringing gender diversity
in technology alongside promoting the usage of open-source frameworks.

We conduct hands-on workshops, organize hackathons, and seminars, where
you get to learn and experiment with various open source technologies,
compete with peers with similar interests and our partnerships with other
chapters and organizations in the university will bring diversified
experiences in a multitude of domains for our club members.

The open-source paradigm is based on the idea that software reuse need not
stop at organizational boundaries. By sharing source code freely under a
license that generously permits copying, modification, and redistribution,
open-source projects allow collaborative software development that
benefits a larger community.
