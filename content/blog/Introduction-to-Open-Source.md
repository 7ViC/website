The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. The open-source model is a decentralized software-development model that encourages open collaboration. Its mainly used to describe software. The user can also make changes in the source code of such software and customize it according to their use. <!-- more -->



The term originated with regards to software development to assign a specific approach to create computer programs. Today, however, 'open source' assigns a broader set of values what we call "the open source way." Open source projects, products or initiatives embrace and commend standards of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development. 

Open source supports universal access to a product's design or blueprints via an open-source or libre license, as well as universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. The open-source model is a decentralized software-development model that encourages open collaboration.

## What is Open-Source?

Open source is source code that is made unreservedly accessible for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version back to the community.

## What is open-source software?
Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

"Source code" is the part of the software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software a "program" or "application" works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

Many open-source projects have a high economic value. According to the Battery Open-Source Software Index (BOSS), the ten economically most important open source projects are:

## Advantages of using open source software

**Control -** We can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything we don't want it to do and we can change parts of it we don't like. Users who aren't programmers also benefit from open-source software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wish not merely the way someone else thinks they should.

**Education -** It helps us become better programmers. Because open-source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comments and critiques, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.

**Security -** It is more secure and stable than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and modify open-source software, someone might spot errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. They can fix, update, and upgrade open-source software more quickly than they can proprietary software.

**Stability -** Users prefer open-source software for important, long-term projects. Because programmers publicly distribute the source code for open-source software, users relying on that software for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop working on them.

## Women's contributions to Open Source

It’s certainly true that most open source efforts start as technical projects, and a lot of the contributions needed are in the form of code. Code was and is highly valued and rewarded by the institutions of open source.
If your team is anything less than an equal balance of men and women, then your team is probably not the best it can be.
Many women make important contributions to an open-source project or the open-source community. For instance, Netha Hussain, Megan Byrd-Sanicki.

### Netha Hussain
> “Believe in yourself, and know that you have the skills and talent to do whatever you’d like to do. Follow your passion, and do what you want. There will be times of uncertainty but always move forward. Keep studying. Keep learning new things. That’s how you grow, both in your field and as a person.”

**Number of years as an open-source contributor:** 10

**Projects or communities:** Wikimedia, Mozilla, TED

**Summary of contributions:**
Netha won the 2020 Academic Award for openly sharing her medical knowledge and increasing the number of topics relevant to women and contributions by women on Wikipedia. Netha is a medical doctor and a PhD candidate in Clinical Neuroscience at the University of Gothenburg. Her research involves using virtual reality technology for individuals who have had a stroke. Netha has made thousands of contributions related to healthcare and women in English and Malayalam languages to Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons. She has organized Wikipedia outreach events for women and LGBTQ+ communities in India. She has translated Mozilla projects and TED talks into the Malayalam language. Her dedication to being a part of a solution through knowledge sharing has led her to currently focus on creating and curating articles about COVID-19 on Wikipedia.

### Megan Byrd-Sanicki
> “Be the leader you need. When there’s a void in leadership, each individual can fill that void for themselves. Every contributor to open source is a leader, whether they’re leading others, leading the community, or just leading themselves. Don’t wait to be given permission and own your awesome.”

**Number of years as an open-source contributor:** 10

**Projects or communities:** Drupal, Open Source Initiative, Go, Linux Foundation, SustainOSS, Covid Act Now, FOSS Responders

**Summary of contributions:**
Megan won the 2020 Community Award for her leadership in creating sustainable and thriving open source communities. Her work as the executive director of the Drupal Association led to a stronger and more sustainable community through the development of revenue models, the introduction of a mentorship program, and the promotion of an inclusive environment for contributors with different skill sets and backgrounds. Through her work as the manager of research and operations at the Open Source Program Office at Google and as a member of the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative, Megan shares lessons learned from individual communities with the open-source community more broadly and strengthens community-to-corporate partnerships. Megan is credited for showing care for contributor wellbeing throughout her open-source efforts. She has currently involved with Covid Act Now, a COVID-19 data modelling project, and with FOSS Responders, a centralized initiative to support open source communities.

## Conclusion
Open source promotes universal access to a product's design or blueprints through an open-source or licenses agreement, as well as universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. The best part of these products is, they can work the same way as the other paid products that perform the same task. This allows individuals and companies to review and modify the source code, blueprint, or design for their customization, curiosity, or troubleshooting needs. It is preferred by professionals and companies in its early stage due to its being easily available as open-source licensed software. If we want to perform any task, we can give it a try to check if the software to do that work is available as open source. That could help us reduce the project cost.
